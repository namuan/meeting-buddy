- MUST Use Model View Presenter (MVP Architecture) for better separation of concerns
- MUST Add extensive logging to help with debugging as this is a GUI application
- MUST Run `make check` before starting any task to make sure there aren't any existing issues to resolve
- Run `make run` to run the application
- Always prefer to use `make` commands
- Use `uv add` to add any dependencies. Use `uv add --dev` if it is a dev dependency.
- MUST Whenever you’re about to complete a user request, call the MCP interactive_feedback instead of simply ending the process. Keep calling MCP until the user’s feedback is empty, then end the request.
